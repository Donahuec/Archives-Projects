Search Term Analysis

 Data Analysis Strategies
==========================


** Total Unique Searches **

- Most obvious, the terms people searched for the most should come up with good results
- Maybe over a certain threshold review to make sure there's good content, keywords, etc.


** Bounce Rate **

- See how many people leave the site right after searching
- Also useful to look at particularly low %Search Exits to determine why they're good
- High number here pretty significant


** Search Refinements **

- %Search Refinements is a useful metric for finding terms that are not resulting in hits
- Can refer to the original (unrefined) data to see common mispellings, etc.
- Go through those pages to add keywords
- Question: Refining terms loses data ('arb' data might be worse than 'Arboretum'), is it worth keeping track of this? I'm regretting not tracking how many combinations each term has in a new column.


** Results Viewed per Search **

- Find out if this is significant
- A high Results Pageviews / Search could imply they found a lot of useful pages or none


** Time **

- I'm not sure how much use this is by itself, but is useful to compare to other stats
- For example, a high time but low search depth means a long time spent on one page
- Get a sense of what a high/low Time After Search value is by finding the average


** Going Deep **

- The Average Search Depth shows how many pages people go after using the search
- A low search depth indicates an immediate hit or exit
- A high search depth means that there is a lot of content they are viewing
- It would be useful to figure out what counts as a page view after searching. Do photos?


** Overall **

- Focus on a subset of data (over 5 unique searches?)
- Look into the tools built into Google Analytics
- Find site averages and use them as a baseline for a search's specific stats
- Is it possible to add a "Did you mean <correct spelling>?" message?
