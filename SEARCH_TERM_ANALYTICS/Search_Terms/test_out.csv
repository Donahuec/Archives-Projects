"Promotional Note That These Videos Are 11-20 Minutes In Length. Let'S Imagine That We Were To Use 1924, 1947, 1957, And 1976 On Loops In Our Exhibition. And Let'S Imagine The Loops Were Just 4 Minutes Long. By What Criteria Would You Edit 20 Down To 4 Minutes? If The Aim Were To Focus Comparisons Among Those Years, Would You Edit To Continuity Or Dis-Continuity? Where Does/Do Core Values Fit In? And, How To Juxtapose The 2016 Website Presentation Of Carleton With These? I Recall Viewing A 1923 Journal That Was Very Rich In Information. A Football Player, I Recall. So, That Would Mesh With The 1924 Video. It Is Also An Interesting Coincidence That Ca 1925 There Was A Polio Outbreak Among Carleton Students, Spread By Milk From The College Farm.
