Let's imagine that we were to use 1924, 1947, 1957, and 1976 on loops in our exhibition. And let's imagine the loops were just 4 minutes long. By what criteria would you edit 20 down to 4 minutes? If the aim were to focus comparisons among those years, would you edit to continuity or dis-continuity? Where does/do CORE VALUES fit in? And, how to juxtapose the 2016 Website presentation of Carleton with these? I recall viewing a 1923 Journal that was very rich in information. A football player, I recall. So, that would mesh with the 1924 video. It is also an interesting coincidence that ca 1925 there was a polio outbreak among Carleton students, spread by milk from the college farm.
