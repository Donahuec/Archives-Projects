The correspondence series is large and arranged alphabetically by Trustee. These are letters the Trustees exchanged with the President, Vice President and other College Officials.	The Minutes series contains minutes of the Board of Trustees, the Executive Committee, and three other committees of the Board. The majority of minutes from 1866-1945 are in bound volumes and are filed separately. The Meeting Documents series is composed of agendas, discussion papers, committee reports, background papers, financial reports, and miscellaneous documents prepared and distributed for meetings of the Board of Trustees. The bulk of the material in this series was collected by the Central Records office of the College and their previous provenance is unknown.	The Committees series includes membership lists, reports and correspondence, and scattered minutes.

Fall Kyoto) began in 1968.  This program followed the Summer Seminar session, and several students attended both.  In 1970, the Carleton-Doshisha Fellowship ended amidst violent unrest on university campuses throughout Japan.  This same year, Carleton began to send students to the East Asian Studies program at Waseda University in Tokyo through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest.	The collection is organized into six series:  Carelton Abroad (1953-56) and Carleton-in-Japan (1956-66), Carleton-Doshisha Fellowship, Japan Summer Seminar, Origins of the Associated Kyoto Program, Carleton-Doshisha Fall Term Program, and ACM East Asian Studies Program in Waseda, Miscellaneous.	The collection includes correspondence, reports, minutes, applications, pamphlets, sample teaching materials, photographs, photo albums, scrapbooks, and items such as a yearbook, filmstrip, and woodblock prints.  These materials were collected from a variety of sources.  The papers, for the most part, were probably gathered from the records of an individual, such as John C. Perry, or a committee, such as the Carleton-in-Japan committee, but there are some groups of papers for which it is difficult to know the provenance.  As a result, while most of the folder arrangements were retained in the processing of the collection, some papers, such as the presidential correspondence and correspondence about the origins of the Associated Kyoto Program were given the best artificial arrangement possible.	Many of the series have a subseries containing the papers of a committee or a director.  These are all very similar.  Almost all of them include minutes, correspondence between committee members or directors with other committee members, correspondence between student representatives and committee members or the director, and financial information.	The contents of the collection is fairly straightforward, but there are a few important items to make note of:  the financial subseries in the Carleton Abroad and Carleton-in-Japan series contains a report prepared for the New World Foundation which gives good information and background to the Carleton-in-Japan program.  Many of the series overlap in subject matter.  The Carleton-in-Japan series, for instance, contains information on the changeover to the Carleton-Doshisha Fellowship and the program itself.  Names of certain people naturally carry over from one series to another, too.  Most of Carleton officials involved in administering the various programs are easily identifiable; some of the other names, however, bear brief identification:  Naozo Ueno and Shin Hoshina-- the first and second presidents of Doshisha that Carleton dealt with; Otis Cary-- the \permanent\"" Amherst representative at Doshisha; Jan Hieronymus-- student chair of the Carleton-in-Japan committee; Ken Akiyama and Sadao Asada-- appointed by the Doshisha president to be the one non-student representative for Carleton at the Doshisha.  Both had either studied or taught at Carleton.",0:16:24,0,60.00%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2670&q=scrap+book,7,4,Carleton scrapbooks and photo albums,1879 - 1988,"Individual and organizational scrapbooks, containing mostly clippings, but also photos, programs, booklets, drawings, invitations, records, correspondence, postcards, dance cards, receipts, and memorabilia.  Topics include athletics, oratory, literary societies, drama, musical groups, graduation and awards, dances and entertainment, clubs, religious activities, professors.  Scrapbooks of organizations are listed in the contents lists for that organization's record group, if any.  For some organizations, the only organized material in the archives is the scrapbook listed here.",0:01:18,0,28.57%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2677&q=chaplain,9,4,Chaplain's Office Records,NULL,NULL,0:01:55,0,11.11%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2694,5,4,Deborah Sayles Hill Diary,1908; 1913-1919; 1925,NULL,0:00:42,0,20.00%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2698,5,4,Departmental and other formal Reviews,1970-2011,NULL,0:01:39,0,0.00%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2698&q=departmental+reviews,7,4,Departmental and other formal Reviews,1970-2011,NULL,0:04:52,0,42.86%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2722&q=hughes+family,6,4,Hughes Family Collection,NULL,NULL,0:02:18,0,16.67%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2730&q=oral+history,4,4,Interviews and oral histories (outside Carleton Oral History Program) Transcripts,NULL,Interviews and oral histories (outside Carleton Oral History Program) Transcripts,0:00:09,0,0.00%/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=2743,6,4,Leal A.

Of special note is a 1949 questionnaire that was sent to one member of each graduating class asking for a written statement of what Carleton meant to them--the responses were used to write that year's celebration of Carleton's first eight decades, and are a good source of information about early student life and attitudes.

Nason (1905-2001) graduated from Carleton College in 1926 with a degree in Philosophy. After his graduation, Nason attended Harvard briefly before spending three years at Oriel College at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, graduating in 1931. He then taught at Swarthmore College until 1940, when he was chosen as the College's President. He served in this role until 1953, when he stepped down to become the President of the Foreign Policy Association. In 1962, he was elected the President of Carleton College where he served in this role until his retirement in 1970.	During his time as President, John W. Nason is known for strengthening cooperation between Carleton and St. Olaf, the institution of the freshman seminar, the expansion of study abroad programs, and the creation of the Asian Studies Department. The years of Nason’s presidency were marked by a general sense of unrest for the students, especially surrounding Civil Rights issues and the conflict in Vietnam.

The soldiers were housed in Carleton dormitories, and some coures were taught by Carelton faculty. The government paid Carleton for the soldiers' tuition, room and board, and other fees, helping the College survive the loss of civilian male students during the war. Several of the ASTP soldiers reenrolled at Carleton when peace returned.	The record group is broken down into series by type of program. The series are composed primarily of transcripts and requests for transcripts, but also include the contracts between the government and Carleton. The Flight Training series also contains notifications of assignments and receipts for lodging, board, and transportation at Carleton.

The Governing Documents series is quite thin, and consists of documents concerning the articles of incorporation and the responsibilities of the Board. Biographical sketches of Board members and membership lists (some with photos) comprise the Biographies and Membership Lists series. The correspondence series is large and arranged alphabetically by Trustee. These are letters the Trustees exchanged with the President, Vice President and other College Officials.	The Minutes series contains minutes of the Board of Trustees, the Executive Committee, and three other committees of the Board. The majority of minutes from 1866-1945 are in bound volumes and are filed separately. The Meeting Documents series is composed of agendas, discussion papers, committee reports, background papers, financial reports, and miscellaneous documents prepared and distributed for meetings of the Board of Trustees. The bulk of the material in this series was collected by the Central Records office of the College and their previous provenance is unknown.	The Committees series includes membership lists, reports and correspondence, and scattered minutes. This is a highly artificial series, composed of documents collected by several different offices of the College; the provenance of a folder is noted in parenthesis after the folder title (\DOC\"" = Dean of the College; \""VP\"" = Vice President; \""VP/Dev\"" = Vice President or Development Office; \""Pres\"" = President; \""CR\"" = Central Records office).

The Standing Curriculum Committee was disbanded in 1971 upon implementation of the present governance system, and its duties were passed on to the Educational Policy Committee.  The Curriculum Committee was charged with examining and monitoring a wide range of issues - such as integrative exercises (comprehensive examination 1969), distribution requirements and the calendar system (1959-61) and individual course numberings and descriptions.  The Committee was composed of representatives from each academic division of the college;  in 1945 its chairmanship was transferred from the President to the Dean of the College.	     The collection also includes records of four ad hoc sub-committees established by the faculty (nominally independent of the Curriculum Committee):  Curricular Revisions Committee (February-July 1958), Sub-Committees A and B on Curricular Review (March-July 1967), and the Ad Hoc Committee on a Core Humanities Program (1967-68).  The Curriculum Committee and the several subcommittees are presented as a subgroups of a single artificial record group, although technically they are all subgroups of the Carleton faculty or of the Dean of the College (depending upon whether one defines provenance by administrative placement or by the particular creator of the particular records).	Additional background:	The Minutes subseries gives an overview of the issues and questions being examined.  Proposals on integrated courses, calendar revision, and distribution requirements are contained in the Proposals Submitted to the Committee subseries.  Of special interest is a proposal on War Programs presented in 1942, and a proposal for an Educational Commune in 1970.  The Faculty Comments and Questionnaires subseries contains documents detailing the views and objections of individual faculty members and academic deprtments to some of these proposals.  Reports prepared and data gathered within Carleton College, such as the Report on Black Studies at Carleton, are filed in the Background Papers subseries.  The Memoranda to the Faculty subseries contains documents notifying the faculty of issues being examined and recommendations of the Committee. Routine	Requests from Faculty pertain to individual courses and instructors: change of course name or description, approval of a new course, change in designated course number.  The Secondary Materials subseries contains background publications from sources outside the College (documents of Macalester College's Conference on the Improvement of Instruction in Colleges of Liberal Arts -1945- are of particular interest).  A document entitled \Comments on Developments in the Carleton Curriculum\"" by Dean Frank R. Kille (1950) is included in the Chairman's Notebooks subseries of the 1945-58 series.  Of note in the Miscellaneous subseries of the 1958-70 series are documents pertaining to the membership of the Dean's ad hoc committee of students on curricular matters (1967).  Other topics of interest which are represented in several sub-series throughout their respective chronological series are a study of integrative exercises (1969) and the examination of calendar options and adoption of the 3-3 system (1959-61).",0:03:25,0,20.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2690,6,2,Dean of Students' Office Records,NULL,NULL,0:00:05,0,33.33%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2694,2,2,Deborah Sayles Hill Diary,1908; 1913-1919; 1925,NULL,0:00:00,2,100.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2763,3,2,News Releases -- Sports,NULL,NULL,0:00:08,1,33.33%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2767,2,2,Off-Campus Studies Collection,1962-1986,NULL,0:13:02,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2776,2,2,Personnel Files maintained by the President's Office,NULL,NULL,0:04:01,0,50.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2779,3,2,Photographic Negatives,Circa 1920-2002,NULL,0:08:16,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2791,2,2,Photographic Prints -- Visitor Publicity,NULL,NULL,0:00:02,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2801,4,2,President's Office Records (Nason),1962-1970,NULL,0:02:31,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2802,4,2,President's Office Records (Oden),2002-2010,NULL,0:01:31,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2803,3,2,President's Office Records (Porter),1986-1987,NULL,0:00:23,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2822,2,2,Student Organization Files,NULL,NULL,0:00:09,0,0.00%/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2833,3,2,Thorstein B.

The correspondence series is large and arranged alphabetically by Trustee. These are letters the Trustees exchanged with the President, Vice President and other College Officials.	The Minutes series contains minutes of the Board of Trustees, the Executive Committee, and three other committees of the Board. The majority of minutes from 1866-1945 are in bound volumes and are filed separately. The Meeting Documents series is composed of agendas, discussion papers, committee reports, background papers, financial reports, and miscellaneous documents prepared and distributed for meetings of the Board of Trustees. The bulk of the material in this series was collected by the Central Records office of the College and their previous provenance is unknown.	The Committees series includes membership lists, reports and correspondence, and scattered minutes.

He then taught at Swarthmore College until 1940, when he was chosen as the College's President.

After his graduation, Nason attended Harvard briefly before spending three years at Oriel College at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, graduating in 1931. He then taught at Swarthmore College until 1940, when he was chosen as the College's President. He served in this role until 1953, when he stepped down to become the President of the Foreign Policy Association. In 1962, he was elected the President of Carleton College where he served in this role until his retirement in 1970.	During his time as President, John W. Nason is known for strengthening cooperation between Carleton and St. Olaf, the institution of the freshman seminar, the expansion of study abroad programs, and the creation of the Asian Studies Department. The years of Nason’s presidency were marked by a general sense of unrest for the students, especially surrounding Civil Rights issues and the conflict in Vietnam.

The first folder contains correspondence and a few publications relating to the appointment of John W. Nason as President of Carleton College in 1962. The second folder primarily holds Carleton Women’s Club newsletters and correspondence. These are addressed to Mrs. Nason and date from 1965 thru 1970. The third folder contains correspondence received and written by Mr. Nason after his retirement from the office of President.

The majority of the collection comes from the years 1940-1980 and was gathered by the college librarians:  Robert McEwen, 1938-45, Marian Adams, 1945-52, James Richards, 1952-68, Robert Bruce, 1969-74, John Perry (acting director), 1975-76, Philip Wei, 1976-79, John Metz, 1979-1998, and Sam Demas, 1998-2011.	The earlier part of the collection consists of the following series:  Annual reports; Subject file by year, 1942-50; Buildings; American University Field Staff, Book Lists, Book Purchases, and a Topical File.  This is basically the original organization of this part of the collection.  The report series contains a complete set of annual reports 1899-1968.  Also of interest is the Buildings series which contains reports on the inadequacy of Scoville and plans for the new library.  The later half consists of 11 series:  Reports, Review, Correspondence, Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM), Budget, Committees, Departments, Departmental Libraries, Grants, Personnel, and a Topical File.  The Departmental Libraries series contains information about the creation of the Science Library in Mudd Hall.

Some publications material which predates creation of the office is also included.	This collection came to the Archives in good condition.  Most of the original folders and labels have been preserved; in processing we merely arranged the folders into a more coherent order.  The first three series deal with the workings of the office:  annual reports, correspondence, printing procedures and costs, awards, covers, and the like.
