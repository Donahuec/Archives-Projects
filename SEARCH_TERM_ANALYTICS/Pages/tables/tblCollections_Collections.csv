Fall Kyoto) began in 1968.  This program followed the Summer Seminar session, and several students attended both.  In 1970, the Carleton-Doshisha Fellowship ended amidst violent unrest on university campuses throughout Japan.  This same year, Carleton began to send students to the East Asian Studies program at Waseda University in Tokyo through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest.	The collection is organized into six series:  Carelton Abroad (1953-56) and Carleton-in-Japan (1956-66), Carleton-Doshisha Fellowship, Japan Summer Seminar, Origins of the Associated Kyoto Program, Carleton-Doshisha Fall Term Program, and ACM East Asian Studies Program in Waseda, Miscellaneous.	The collection includes correspondence, reports, minutes, applications, pamphlets, sample teaching materials, photographs, photo albums, scrapbooks, and items such as a yearbook, filmstrip, and woodblock prints.  These materials were collected from a variety of sources.  The papers, for the most part, were probably gathered from the records of an individual, such as John C. Perry, or a committee, such as the Carleton-in-Japan committee, but there are some groups of papers for which it is difficult to know the provenance.  As a result, while most of the folder arrangements were retained in the processing of the collection, some papers, such as the presidential correspondence and correspondence about the origins of the Associated Kyoto Program were given the best artificial arrangement possible.	Many of the series have a subseries containing the papers of a committee or a director.  These are all very similar.  Almost all of them include minutes, correspondence between committee members or directors with other committee members, correspondence between student representatives and committee members or the director, and financial information.	The contents of the collection is fairly straightforward, but there are a few important items to make note of:  the financial subseries in the Carleton Abroad and Carleton-in-Japan series contains a report prepared for the New World Foundation which gives good information and background to the Carleton-in-Japan program.  Many of the series overlap in subject matter.  The Carleton-in-Japan series, for instance, contains information on the changeover to the Carleton-Doshisha Fellowship and the program itself.  Names of certain people naturally carry over from one series to another, too.  Most of Carleton officials involved in administering the various programs are easily identifiable; some of the other names, however, bear brief identification:  Naozo Ueno and Shin Hoshina-- the first and second presidents of Doshisha that Carleton dealt with; Otis Cary-- the \permanent\"" Amherst representative at Doshisha; Jan Hieronymus-- student chair of the Carleton-in-Japan committee; Ken Akiyama and Sadao Asada-- appointed by the Doshisha president to be the one non-student representative for Carleton at the Doshisha.  Both had either studied or taught at Carleton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2670,1,1,35,28,Carleton scrapbooks and photo albums,Carleton scrapbooks and photo albums,1879 - 1988,NULL,1879,1988,NULL,0,0,"Individual and organizational scrapbooks, containing mostly clippings, but also photos, programs, booklets, drawings, invitations, records, correspondence, postcards, dance cards, receipts, and memorabilia.  Topics include athletics, oratory, literary societies, drama, musical groups, graduation and awards, dances and entertainment, clubs, religious activities, professors.  Scrapbooks of organizations are listed in the contents lists for that organization's record group, if any.  For some organizations, the only organized material in the archives is the scrapbook listed here.",NULL,Item number,0,up to 3.5 cu. ft.,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Volumes donated individually.,NULL,Value Code: 2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,LOCATION CHECKED,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,2674,1,1,34,114,Carlton C.

The Committee was composed of representatives from each academic division of the college;  in 1945 its chairmanship was transferred from the President to the Dean of the College.	     The collection also includes records of four ad hoc sub-committees established by the faculty (nominally independent of the Curriculum Committee):  Curricular Revisions Committee (February-July 1958), Sub-Committees A and B on Curricular Review (March-July 1967), and the Ad Hoc Committee on a Core Humanities Program (1967-68).

After his graduation, Nason attended Harvard briefly before spending three years at Oriel College at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, graduating in 1931. He then taught at Swarthmore College until 1940, when he was chosen as the College's President. He served in this role until 1953, when he stepped down to become the President of the Foreign Policy Association. In 1962, he was elected the President of Carleton College where he served in this role until his retirement in 1970.	During his time as President, John W. Nason is known for strengthening cooperation between Carleton and St. Olaf, the institution of the freshman seminar, the expansion of study abroad programs, and the creation of the Asian Studies Department. The years of Nason’s presidency were marked by a general sense of unrest for the students, especially surrounding Civil Rights issues and the conflict in Vietnam.

The main task of the registrar is the issuance and recording of student grades, but other duties include: arranging registration, issuing transcripts, computing grade indexes, compiling names of seniors to reommend for graduation, and recommending students for honors and awards.	The bulk of the collection contains the results of yet another task of the registrar: compiling studies, reports, and data on a wide variety of topics. These range from classroom space studies to reports on faculty grading to data on the correlation between standardized college entrance exams and grades. Especially complete is the demographic section, with topics like Geographical Distribution and Church Affiliation. The collection also contains--in Enrollment, Demographics: Summer Session, and Misc.: ASTU--some interesting material on veteran enrollment during World War II.

This collection documents Robert Will’s role both on Carleton's campus and in the Minnesota community as a professor, an administrator, and a consultant.	[b]Series 1: American Studies 65 - Poverty Seminar[/b] is an example of a Carleton interdisciplinary course. The Poverty Seminar focused on the phenomena of poverty and affluence in modern society from the perspective of sociology, psychology, political science, economics, and contemporary literature. Included are recordings of class meetings, students’ journals, applications for admission into the seminar, and syllabus materials for this course.	[b]Series 2: Economics[/b] consists of course and administrative materials from the Economics Department. Some featured materials are syllabi from Economics courses taught in the 1987/88 academic year, miscellaneous Economics examinations from that same year, correspondence between Carleton and St. Olaf on the cooperation between the two schools' economics departments, and a large file of information regarding an Insurance Executive in Residence program that was coordinated by Robert Will in 1984.	[b]Series 3: Carleton Administration[/b] is a small collection of materials from Robert Will’s time serving on the Curriculum Advisory Committee. The primary focus of these folders is on grant funding for campus programs and independent study projects.	[b]Series 4: First Bank Systems (FBS) Summer Executive Seminar[/b] documents the FBS Summer Program and includes administrative information about room assignments and general orientation for the participants, as well as copies of mailings that were distributed to participants. It also features complete participant notebooks for each year of the FBS program at Carleton and other related materials for courses taught by visiting scholars each year. The photographs that were interfiled in this collection have been moved to the photographic prints collection.	[b]Series 5: Adult Education Programs[/b] focuses on Robert Will's proposed adult education programming and related grant applications.	[b]Series 6: MN Employment Security Department Advisory Council[/b] includes one folder of correspondence and related materials from Robert Will’s time serving on this Advisory Council.	[b]Series 7: Postcards[/b] consists of a large number of postcards written to Robert Will from 1959 to 1991.

	The FCRA, of which Maitland was chair, was charged with analyzing the status of religion at Carleton, making recommendations about the proper role of religion, and, more specifically, studying the chapel attendence requirement.  The material in this collection largely duplicates that found in the FCRA record group, except for Maitland's personal notes.
	Maitland also headed the SFTF, 1970-75.  The task force studied the issues of a job placement service at Carleton, the role of a liberal arts education in preparing students for careers, and other issues relating to the employment of Carleton students.  Especially noteworthy in this series is the task force's report which recognized the need to counsel students to better prepare them for life after Carleton--one response to this suggestion was the Office of Career Planning and Placement.  Also of interest are the position papers of the task force members, outlining basic concerns.
	Maitland's notes and memos make up much of the series relating to relgious services.  The \faculty and student conversations\"" were a series of discussions in the chapel", led by a group of professors," which dealty generally with the topic of education.  Included here are Maitland's memos to these professors and some transcriptions of the \""conversations.\""  In the early 1980s"," Maitland began the chapel \""experiment","\"" in which morning chapel services were abandoned in favor of evening vespers and various forums held in the mornings.  Programs", memos, and evaluations of this experiment will be found in this series.  Also in this series is correspondence, memos, and secondary material relating both to Black Church services and the Holocaust Memorials.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2862,1,1,38,35,Carleton in China,Carleton in China Program,1903-1950,NULL,1903,1950,NULL,11,7,"The Carleton Mission was organized in 1903, due largely to the efforts of recently-graduated alumni Watts O.

The Executive Committee, chaired by the Dean of the College, made policy recommendations for discussion and action during faculty meetings, acted on cases of plagiarism and poor academic standing, approved grade changes, take-home examinations, and course field trips when requested by an instructor, and selected students for honors and scholarships.	The current arrangement of the collection is largely artificial;  much of the material was bound into books containing a mixture of minutes, correspondence, and other documents.  This material was separated into six series:  Minutes (1945-71), General Policy (1946-70), Petitions (1946-66), Academic Standing Issues (1946-66), Prizes, Scholarships, and Off-Campus Programs (1946-66), and Miscellaneous.  The Minutes series contains a separate folder of indices of the minutes and, interspersed with the committee minutes, an occasional year-long summary of committee actions.  The minutes of the Sub-Committee on Petitions, established on November 8, 1967, are filed with the regular committee minutes.  The General Policy series includes discussion of grading policy, the honor system and, in 1965, the possibility of creating an Air Force ROTC program with St. Olaf.	The Petitions series contains a folder of faculty petitions for waiver of final exams and requests for field trips, and a folder of requests from student organizations such as KARL and the proposed Fair Play for Cuba Committee (of note is a studen proposal for a \Junior Year On Campus\"").  The Academic Standing Issues series pertains to cases of plagiarism", excessive class cuts, and other problems with individual students.  Recommendations for Rhodes scholarships and Carleton teaching fellowships as well as other honors for students are contained in the Prizes," Scholarships and Off-Campus series.

The files from 1878-1945 were quite disorganized, and the processor has imposed an artificial order to organize them.  The files from 1945-85, however, were much more organized and generally the folders were preserved and the series reconstructed.  The collection is broken down into subgroups that not only reflect the directors in office, but, more important, the original order of the material and the major changes in the functions of the office.  The files of Breckenridge and Leighton are dominated by fundraising; the files of Cason, Nicholson, and Larson are domenated by clubs and tours; and the file of Whittemore are dominated by reunions and special events.

A crucial gap in the records of both Committees A and B and the Curriculum Committee occurs from mid-July 1967 to March 1968, as the ad hoc committees reported its findings and circulated its fi-nal proposals to the faculty (a few documents from these months are filed in the Proposals and Background Papers series of the Commit-tees A and B subgroup).

The Committee met daily for four weeks beginning in late June and presented a written report to the President in late July.  Copies of the report were circulated to the faculty and their opinions were solicited by and discussed with the Dean and the Curriculum Committee.

Also reflective of student life are the minutes from AMA meetings, in which issues such as chapel conduct and the Social Committee's arrangement of dates and chaperones figured prominently.  Also interesting in the meeting minutes is a debate begun at the May 18," 1922 meeting of the Association (\""Meeting Minutes:  AMA"," 1920-25\""):  at issue were the subjects of student apathy and stronger self-governance.
