It was built and installed in 1975-1976, as the building was being completed, in the computer room on the first floor of Mudd (the floor between the geology lab floor on the ground level and the chemistry lab floor on the second floor level).	The original time-sharing computers on campus had limited capacity, so there were 12 lines coming to Mudd from the computer center in the basement of Laird Hall. Mudd Hall had a computer line into each of the labs (26 locations) when it was originally built, and no lines into any of the faculty of staff offices. So there could be a computer terminal in any of the labs, as long as the total number did not exceed 12. When someone wanted to activate a terminal in a new room, they would move a patch line from another terminal to connect the room that the new terminal was in. The type of 4-prong plugs used both in the patch panel and in the wall outlets is known as “Jones plugs.” The patch panel was removed from the building when it was rewired for a new Ethernet network in 1994. The new network was fed by fiber optic lines from the central computing center and provided hundreds of new network outlets in the building.	The rolls of yellow paper are computer programs or data files stored on punch tape. In the early days of computing on campus hard disks did exist, but they were unreliable and so all important files were backed up on punch tape using the Teletype terminals to do the punching. Often when the computer crashed (a frequent occurrence), the hard disk was corrupted as well.	The construction of this patch panel represents a work style that was used widely at Carleton in the 1970s and 1980s, but which has now largely disappeared: having trades people from the Carleton shop building things on campus with the assistance of student workers. The patch panel box was built and installed by a Carleton carpenter, and the painting and wiring was done by student workers under the supervision of Computer Center technical staff people. By the end of the 20th century Carleton trades people in the Facilities Department rarely built new facilities although they were still involved in trouble-shooting and repairs, and they still had student workers as assistants but campus-wide most student work jobs were more academic in nature. When Mudd Hall was rewired with an Ethernet network in 1994, all the work was done by outside contractors.	Tim Vick, Carleton College Geology Dept. 1/7/2010",Patch panel that was the central hub of the original time-sharing computer wiring network in Mudd Hall of Science.,NULL,NULL,4/18/16 14:081938,1,20160322,Cowling Gymnasium - Women's Athletics Materials,3/22/16,1960-1985,5.5,1,0,0,16,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Five boxes of materials,"Materials pulled from file cabinets in Cowling Gymnasium on 3/22/2016.
