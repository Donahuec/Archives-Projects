Search Term Analysis
Updated Process


----- Intro -----

Following up with the work outlined in Notes.txt, here I go through an updated approach to analysing the data from a year's worth of search terms.



----- Getting the Data -----

- Go to Google Analytics for the Carleton Archives
- In the left menu bar, click Behavior -> Site Search -> Search Terms
- At the top right of the page select the desired time frame (I did data for one year)
- At the bottom right of the page click the Show rows drop down and select 5000
- Back at the top of the page under the title Search Terms, click Export and then CSV
- If there are more results than 5000, go to the next page of results and export again
- Combine results into a single CSV file using excel  


----- Cleaning the Data -----

- Run st_cleanup.py on the CSV file
