0-No Original Date entry (Not included in spreadsheet)

1-No Change from original, should match accepted formats.

4-(+ or - x year(s)): items relating to the format (yyyy)(+ or minus (x)year(s))

5-Extracting a year from dates: For example, if we have an original item
such as 'February 12, 1994' the extracted data in this category will be '1994'

6-Corrections/ formatting for 'Date; Date;... Date' Format: replacing commas and 
spaces with semi-colons, etc.

7-Various Format Fixes: Generally making sure there isn't extra white space, and 
other such small format corrections

8-Various Changes: Changes that either don't fit in well to a category, or 
where done on a very specific scale

9-In 'Date; Date;... Date' Format with a 'yyyy-yyyy' item included. May need changing to 'yyyy/yy'
For instance, there might be an item '1972; 1975-1976; 1980-1985' that could be changed to '1972; 1975/76; 1980-1985'.
These may merit glancing over by hand. Some of these items are originally from category 1 and are still in their original form.
